New Beginnings has no physical shelter and relies on volunteers from all across the country. They are compassionate men and women who open up their homes and donate their time and resources for the benefit of the dogs entrusted to them.
<br>
We welcome those who wish to join us in our mission to make a difference in the lives of these animals.
